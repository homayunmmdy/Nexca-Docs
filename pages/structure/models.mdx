# 🌐 Understanding the Model Structure in Nexca

In Nexca, the **models** play a critical role in organizing and managing the data structure of the application. Here, we'll break down how models are structured within the Nexca project.

## 🔍 Where Are the Models Located?

All models in Nexca are organized in the following directory:

```
/src/models
```

This folder contains all the necessary files and folders related to models, ensuring a clean and maintainable structure.

## 📂 What's Inside `/src/models`?

Within the `/src/models` directory, you'll find:

### 🔢 Model Folders
- **Post**: Handles data and logic related to posts.
- **Services**: Manages the service-related data structure.
- **Section**: Stores data structures for various sections in the application.
- and more

### 🔧 Utility Files
- **schemaOptions**: Defines reusable schema options for models.
- **Database Connections**: Configures and manages database connections.
- Other useful files for enhancing the models' functionality.

## 📊 Why This Structure Matters

This organized structure helps:
1. **Maintain Readability**: Developers can easily navigate and understand the models.
2. **Enhance Reusability**: Utility files like `schemaOptions` can be reused across multiple models.
3. **Simplify Maintenance**: Logical separation of models reduces complexity.
