# RequestHandler 📄

The **RequestHandler** is a foundational component of the Nexca project, playing a crucial role in managing **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It encapsulates reusable logic for handling requests and responses efficiently, ensuring our backend operations are robust and maintainable. You can find the implementation [here](https://github.com/nexca/repository) in the Nexca repository.

## What Is a Request Handler? 🤔

A **request handler** is a utility that centralizes the logic for processing client requests. It acts as a bridge between the client and the database, ensuring that data is correctly fetched, created, updated, or deleted. In this context, the `RequestHandler` class in Nexca handles interactions with **MongoDB models** while optionally supporting **caching** during development.

This class simplifies error handling and provides consistent responses, which is essential for creating scalable and reliable APIs.


## Why Is It Important? 🌟

The `RequestHandler`:

- **Streamlines CRUD operations**: By consolidating logic into a single reusable class, it avoids redundancy across endpoints. 🔄
- **Handles caching**: During development, it can serve data directly from a local cache, reducing database calls and speeding up the development process. ⚡
- **Manages errors gracefully**: It includes a consistent structure for error responses, making debugging and client-side error handling easier. 🛠️
- **Supports scalability**: Its modular design makes it easy to extend functionality as the application grows. 📈

## How the RequestHandler Works ⚙️

The `RequestHandler` class accepts two parameters during initialization:

1. A **MongoDB Model** (via Mongoose) for database operations.
2. A **Cache array**, which can store mock data for development purposes.

It provides the following methods:

### 1. `GetAll()` 📂
Retrieves all records from the database or the cache, depending on the environment:
- In **development mode**, it fetches data from the Cache.
- In **production mode**, it queries the database.

### 2. `Post(req: Request, successMessage: string)` ➕
Creates a new record in the database using the request body. It returns a success message or an error response.

### 3. `Get(id: string)` 🔍
Fetches a specific record by its ID:
- In **development mode**, it searches in the cache.
- In **production mode**, it queries the database.

### 4. `PUT(id: string, req: Request, successMessage: string)` ✏️
Updates an existing record identified by its ID. The request body contains the updated data.

### 5. `DELETE(id: string, successMessage: string)` 🗑️
Deletes a record by its ID and returns a success message if the deletion was successful.

### 6. `ErrorResponse(err: any)` ❌
A utility method to send a standardized error response when operations fail.



## Example Usage 🛠️

Here’s how you might use the `RequestHandler` in your API routes:

```javascript
import RequestHandler from "@/util/handler/RequestHandler";
import { MyModel } from "@/models/MyModel";

// Initialize the handler
const handler = new RequestHandler(MyModel, []);

// Example API route
export async function GET() {
  return handler.GetAll();
}

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  return handler.Post(req, "Record created successfully");
}
```

## Key Features 🔑

- **Environment-Specific Behavior** 🌍  
  The class adapts based on the environment (dev vs. production), improving performance during development.

- **Error Handling** 🚨  
  Errors are logged and returned in a structured JSON format, maintaining consistency across the application.

- **Flexibility** 🧩  
  Since the `RequestHandler` is a generic class (`<T>`), it can be used with any Mongoose model, making it highly reusable.


## Conclusion 🎯

The `RequestHandler` is one of the most important utilities in Nexca, offering a clean, consistent, and scalable way to manage CRUD operations. With its robust error handling and development-friendly features, it sets a strong foundation for building efficient APIs. 🚀
